# Instructions
the purpose for this project is make beat from scratch by using raylib libraries for python.
for that reason you need to install raylib:
- pip install raylib-py (or go to : (https://pypi.org/project/raylib/) ) on your python project environment.
- I also had to install raylibpy to access graphics and audio features of this library : pip install raylib-py.
- Inside my project directory i added a folder named resources where i loaded my wav files (audio sounds : free download [title] ( https://hiphopmakers.com/40-free-music-producer-free-drum-kits#Free-Essential-Drum-Kit))
# Steps of the python scripts
1. import raylibpy as rl
2. Initialize screen parameters by using rl.init_window
3. Initialize the audio device by using rl.init_audio_device
4. create variables to load the wav files using rl.load_sound
5. set the game timing per frames per second(fps) rl.set_target_fps
6. Initialize the Main game loop
7. Initialise the draw of the window
8. Add texts and colour to window created
9. De-Initialization when window is closed

# Lessons learned
1. properly setting my virtual environment
2. activate ps1
3. basic knowlege to raylibpy
